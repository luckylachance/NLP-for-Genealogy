the first to be elected for this office was lyle towne who held the position until 1955. to date monson has had four town managers.
"the first settler in this town was joseph bearce, who came from hebron in 1816. he had been here the pre vious year and felled a few trees."
he commenced on lot numbered nine in the second range.
"during that summer, 1816, he cleared a field and built a small log house."
this was the first house in town.
"it was situated a few rods north of the road now leading from our village to blanchard, and near where the road formerly known as the ""dudley road"" leaves the blanchard road."
in the spring of 1818 he married nancy ricker of paris.
in the autumn of the same year death claimed him for its victim.
while mr.
"bearce lived in this town, the path from abbot to the settlement diverged from the path leading to million acres, now blanchard, and finding a pair of moosehorns, mr."
b. placed them upon a post as a guide board.
from that time on they served as a guide-post for the many settlers traveling on these spotted trails.
"in 1882, william weeks shot a moose and put its horns on the post."
he painted million acres on one horn and mon son on the other horn.
on aug.
"25, 1914, the piscataquis historical siciety held a dedication ceremony replacing another set."
several pairs were stolen over the years and some were simply demolished from the elements.
"in june of 1955, still another pair was mounted on the iron post."
this was the sixth set of moosehorns dating from 1817 to 1955. on oct.

"tisbury m31001' chapter placed a bronze marker at the ""moosehorns"" to preserve the historic landmark."
"in 1816, geo."
"doughty from gray, and simeon irish, from hebron, commenced to fell trees in what has since been known as the ""witham neighborhood""."
mr.
"irish built a small house that fall and moved into it in 1817. history of monson, maine 11 this was the first frame house in town, and was covered with shaved clapboards, without any boarding."
it was situated on what was afterwards known as the fogg place near j. b. draper's the now abandoned moose horn to blanchard road.
(the draper farm was des troyed by fire.)
mr.
"doughty raised some crops on his land in 1817, and built a log house, into which, with a wife and five children, he moved in march, 1818. these were the first children in town."
samuel rowe and wife from hebron came to monson the same year.
"in the fall of 1818, james stanchfield came from albion, and in february 1819, moved with his family into the house built by mr."
bearce.
"the house he built was the first house built in the east half of monson, or on that part granted to monson academy, and the place where, for some length of time, the peope were accus tomed to meet for religious worship and for other purposes."
"this house was used for several years as a dwelling-house, meeting--houseand school-house."
it stood on the spot where joseph daine's buildings stood in 1872.
(located in the general area opposite the finn hall on rt.
15.)
"in the spring of 1819, joseph jackson and wife, with a family of eight children, came from no."

"here he erected a log house and lived several years; after which he moved into the east half of the town, living on the farm occupied by h. c. pullen in 1872 (now stanwood pullen's farm)."
"the same sea son, samuel weymouth, amos atkinson and abial pack ard came with their families and commenced making homes for themselves."

a. atkinson's child died suddenly between the ages of two and three months old.
"in the summer of 1818, the trustees of monson acad emy sent abel goodell to explore the township, thus to be able to recommend to others to come here to find or rather to make themselves homes."
"in the fall of 1819, capt."
"amasa chapin traded with the trustees of the academy for one mile square of land, in the east half of this town, taking the same in part pay for his farm in monson, mass."
"(his home was built on the present site of edward kugler's farm, n. guilford road.)"

.
they left monson mass.
in april.
"they were about three weeks on the way, and spent the sabbath, may 7th, at capt."
"chapin's in abbot, where they left the women and children for a few days, coming here on monday, may 8th."
they stopped a few days in mr.
"stanchfield's house, and then went to mr."
"atkinson's where they found a home until they could clear away the forest sufficiently to build a house, which was soon ready for their recep tion."
this house stood on the spot where h. g. sherman's house stood in 1872 (now known as louise grover's home) and was the first house in the village and the second framed house in town.
it was the home of capt.
"whitney as long as he was a resident of this town, and history of monson, maine 13 for several years was a temporary home for quite a num ber of other families, they stopping here until they could construct some sort of house for themselves."
"in the winter and spring of 1822 and 1823, no less ."
than five families found a home in this house at the same time.
"these were the families of samuel whitney, james whiting, william a. hyde, lucius hyde, and this in a house twenty-two feet by thirty and unfinished."
"in this house, the first birth in the east half of the town, and the first in the families from massachusetts after their arrival here, occurred on the first day of january, 1821. this was a daughter to william a. hyde and wife."
this child was known as mrs.
"catherine m. giddings of portland in 1872. in the summer of 1820, the dam was built across the outlet of the pond, thus flooding the little pond and rendering more valuable the water power."

mr.
cushman's was the fifteenth family in town.
"the same spring, austin newell brought his wife, whom 14 history of monson, maine he had returned to monson, mass., to marry; and with them came hiram vinton."
"in the spring of 1822, there also came from oxford county, cyrus packard, william bowker and cornelius barrows."
zibeon packard came about the same time.
"abel goodell who came in 1818 to explore the township, left monson, mass, in the spring of 1821. leaving his family in harmony, he came here and cleared his farm."
"the next winter he moved his family as far as guilford, where they stayed one year."
"he was considered a resi dent in this town, voting and holding office in 1822, although his family did not arrive here until may, 1823. although there appears to have been but twenty-one voters here in april, 1822, and only twenty-five votes cast for governor in september of the same year, yet upon an old tax list of 1822 there were names of thirty two resident taxpayers."
"the names on that list, not already mentioned, are nathaniel bennett, reuben cush man, samuel tobin, george hathaway and isaac stone."
hathaway and stone were young men employed that season by capt.
chapin.
"the others lived here with their families and probably came in 1821 or the spring of 1822. in october, 1822, james whiting and family, five in all, came from wrentham, mass., and lived with mr."
whitney and mr.
"atkinson, until mr."
"whiting could build a house, when they moved on to the place known as the whiting farm (now bessie doble's on water street)."
"in the spring of 1823, alexander greenwood, esq., who had been employed by the trustees of hebron acad emy in 1811, to lot their portion of this township, and afterwards by monson academy to survey and lot the remainder of the town, moved from hebron and settled on the land formerly known as the watson farm (now owned by andrew sophrer of dexter) and located beyond the r. mathews' farm."

a. davison came from vermont.
mr.
goodell lived on the present site of lloyd ke1ley's home and orchards and mr.
davison moved into dea.
"hyde's house, which had been built that summer."
this house belonged to j. p. haynes in 1872 and was the second house built in the village.
here dr.
"davison lived until 1825, in the sum mer of which year he built the house which is the present home of mr."
and mrs.
fred finley on center st.
and moved into it in the autumn.
sometime during this year samuel and zebedee thomas and john packard settled in the west part of town.
daniel briggs also came the same year.
"in 1824, william connor, simeon davee, john crafts, solomon cushman, john morton and oliver eveleth, became residents of this town."
"in 1826, no less than nine men, most of them having families, moved into town."
they were capt.
"j. mathews, r. k. packard, joseph barrett, roland taylor, vvarren dudley, joshua buck, david goodell, benjamin ward and john b. packard."
"in 1827 came joseph booth, h. g. o. harmon, george dunham, william goding and abel jewett."
"in 1828, abner brown, william d. hoar, milton hoar, thomas towns and solomon bray."
mr.
"bray probably had the largest family ever living in this town, fourteen children, seven sons and seven daughters, all of whom lived to be men and women."
"post office: in the year 1824 or 1825, the post office in this town was established."
"before this, all the mail matter desig nated for this place stopped at sangerville, and the inhabitants were obliged to go twelve miles to mail or to receive a letter or paper."
frederic f. gates was the first post master and hiram doughty the first mail carrier.
mr.
"d. was succeeded, in a short time, by benjamin 16 history of monson, maine stanchfield, who every saturday for two years, went on foot to esq."
"kelsey's in guilford, returning in the same day, with the mail, and being obliged to cross the piscat aquis river twice each way - in the best manner he could for there was no bridge - in order to leave the mail at the post office in abbot."
"for this service the government paid these men two shillings a trip, or a little more than one cent for each mile of travel."
"they usually had some errands to do for the inhabitants, for which they received some trifling compensation."
"as they approached the post office, and sometimes as they passed the houses, they sounded a trumpet before them to inform the people that the mail was coming, and that there was an oppor tunity for any one who wished to send errands."
"in 1827, the mail was carried by deacon fuller from bangor to monson, once a week; and in 1831 mail arrived in mon-, son three times a week."
after 1883 monson had mail twice daily except on weekends.
"on february 6, 1960, the new metro system was introduced and mail arrives at 8:00 a.m."
and leaves at 5:00 p.m.
daily except sundays.
the postmaster was chosen according to the politi-- cal party in power to which he belonged.
(note: this no longer applies as it is a civil service position.)
"therefore, the post office has been housed in several buildings in town: 1882, the present c. bickford home; 1889, present monson light and power co."
"block; 1910-1911, present t. moore block; 1912, present m. l."
& p. go.
"block; then, present monson variety store; 1940's, moved to its present location in the t. moore block."
"(note: recent postmasters: alner gilbert, edward johnson, harvey gilbert, harland johnson.)"
"erma johnson small is the present postmaster with the following part time em ployees: neola jacobson, eloise stevens, and dagmar greenleaf."
"history of monson, maine 17 (note of interest ---- the shed now attached to the present home of paul allen on garage st."
was built on main st.
after the fire of 1911. it was used temporarily as a drug store and postoffice.)
"first electricity in monson: on january 25, 1908, monson had its first electricity."
the power was generated right here in monson by using water power from lake hebron.
"later, when the water couldn't generate enough power for the monson, maine slate co."
"to run their machines, they purchased the power from greenville which was generated at wilson pond."
monson light and power co.
"was incorporated in december of 1907, with the monson, maine slate co."
own ing all the stock.
in june of 1944 francis marshall bought all the stock of the monson light and power go.
from the slate co.
and bought the electricity wholesale from cen tral maine power co.
"then in june of 1964, central maine power took over the distribution facilities in the town."
"first telephones in monson: there are no records to confirm this statement, but it was said that the first telephones in monson, were at the monson, maine slate co."
"quarry and quarry offices, and that it just ""grew like topsy"" from that time on."
mr.
fred crane was superintendent of the monson slate co.
"at that time, and he took over the telephone business and carried it on as a private enterprise as long as he lived, although it was never a paying proposition."
"the southeast monson telephone co., more commonly known as the ""farmers line"" was formed by the residents in the southeast part of monson and was connected to the outside through fred crane's co."
"the telephone busi ness was sold in 1946 to the new england telephone 18 history of monson, maine co."
which established a nice telephone office in monson in the present donald keene block (now used as a barber shop) and employed several people at the time.
"on july 28, 1955, monson went onto the dial system at 12:01 a. m. and from that time on operators were no longer needed."
"at the present time, monson cannot dial direct as can many of the other cities and towns, but is in hope of being able to do so in the near future."
"monson free public library: january 16, 1909, seven citizens of monson peti tioned the state expressing their desire to be incorporated under the provisions of chapter 57 of the revised stat utes of 1903 and amendments and maintaining a free public library."
"february 4, 1909, a certificate of organi zation of the monson free public library association was filed in the office of the secretary of state at augusta, and said organization was duly notified."
"the first books purchased were books written by stevenson, harte, dickens and history books, numbering 90 in all."
by feb.
"6, 1910 the library had 636 books."
"in 1947, the womans club of monson appointed a committee to work with one of the state librarians discarding all outdated books."
"at this time, the library was completely redecor ated and the books catalogued according to the dewey decimal system."
it was located at this time in what is now the monson's historical museum.
"on april 19, 1969, the library moved into its new home in the new municipal building in back of the town office."
it contains approximately 5000 volumes.

"history of monson, maine 19 monson's schools the early settlers were very anxious for their child ren to be educated and the very first schools were held in private homes, this being before the town was incor porated."
"in 1823, a schoolhouse was erected near the center of the town."
"traveling conditions being very difficult, it soon became necessary to have neighborhood schools."
"in 1827-28, a school was built in the day district, and by 1848, there were schools in various localities."
"there were eight rural school houses, those being: (1) old burma school - located on blanchard road, abandoned 1906. this building no longer stands."
"(2) new burma school located on the blanchard road, opened in the spring of 1906. this building still stands and is privately owned and now called the wagon wheels."
(3) new long dis trict school - located on the monson-guilford road.
presently it is known as the finn hall used by the finnish farmers club.
this one was in use in 1907.
"(4) north neighborhood school --located up by drake's corner, elliottsville road near esmond richards' home."
this building has tumbled down.
(5) vinton school house located at the corner of the williniantic and s. e. mon son roads.
this building was moved to its present location across from charles strom's home in southeast monson in 1921. this is the original building and has never been used for anything but a schoolhouse.
(6) red school house - located on n. guilford road below day's crossing and southeast monson road.
this building is now gone.
(7) barrows falls school - located between blanchard and barrows falls.
"this building was in use 20 history of monson, maine in 1906-07, but is now gone."
(8) old long district school - located on the guilford road near ladd brook below arthur nelson's house.

"monson elementary school --the first grammar school building called ""old schoolhouse"" was located between monson academy and the church cemetery."
"this building burned march 31, 1899, and was rebuilt on the present site."
this school being centrally located made it possible to transport boys and girls to the village by bus.
the district schools were closed by 1939. monson academy owes its birth to private enter prise.
there was a group of people who were determined that the boys and girls of this little hamlet should have all the advantages of the times.
this group was made up of fifty--fourcitizens who were later named as corporat ors.
"the corporators proved their eagerness for an in.sti tution of higher learning by subscribing $1,000.00 for the purpose of establishing an academy for the education and improvement of youth."
"a committee of three peti tioned the legislature for its incorporation june 14, 1847, and the act of incorporation was approved by gov."
"john w. dana, and can be found in chapter 62 of the acts of that year."
"the corporate name was ""stockholders of monson academy"", each subscriber holding a number of shares corresponding to his subscription."
"the corporators met for organization at ""centre school house"" in monson on sept."
"4, 1847. dr."
"alpheus davison was chosen chairman and ephriam flint, clerk."
on sept.
"18, 1847 the following were chosen: lucius bradford, pres."
"- zenas scales, v. pres."
"- ephriam flint, clerk and aretus chapin, treas., with fifteen trustees."
"the building was erected by joseph lombard, for $935.51, the total cost including a heating system being $1,014.87."
the building was dedicated aug.
"28, 1848. history of monson, maine 21 the legislature granted the institution a half township, which was sold dec."
"2, 1852, for $3,000.00."
for several years the sum constituted the entire endowment of the academy.
"the original building was two stories high measuring 37 by 40 feet with the school on the ground floor and the hall above being used for a recreation room and for concerts, lectures and other public purposes."
"the academy had a small, well-selected library."
the first session of school was held in the fall of 1848 with 106 persons in attendance.
"march 1860, the academy was burned to the ground."
"reconstruction was started immediately and the framework of this structure measuring 37 by 56 feet was still uncovered when fire again selected monson as its victim, destroying the greater part of the village.in spite of all obstacles the stalwart people of monson finished building the academy in 1860. the 1861 legislature granted monson academy one fourth of a township in aroostook county, which the trustees sold jan."
"24, 1864, to george k. jewett of bangor, for $2,000.00."
the in terior of the building was finished on the strength of this grant.
"the first session of school was held in the new academy in 1861, and continued under the direction of the trustees until 1872, when the academy united with the high school in exchange for a grant made by the town for this purpose."
the academy was then governed by the trustees and the school committee.
"on july 1, 1892, the first floor of the academy was made into two school rooms and the high school was calcimined."
"on january 2, 1901, the academy was made free for the students of monson village."
"a on january 16, 1908, arrangements for a laboratory were made."
"march 16, 1922, $100.00 was spent for installing electric lights for the academy."
"1 22 history of monson, maine february 27, 1924, $3,000.00 was spent remodeling the academy."
"the academy celebrated its one hundredth birth day in the summer of 1947. the same building was used with slight changes in remodeling the inside with up-to-date heating, lighting and plumbing facilities until 1968, when the academy consolidated with school administrative district no."
68. the academy and elementary buildings were remodeled to house the grades from kindergarten thru the sixth grade.
the seventh thru twelfth grades travel by bus to dover-foxcroft to attend grammar school and foxcroft academy.
a gymnasium was one of monson's big needs for a great many years.
"in 1940 & 1941, the monson commun ity hall fund was organized and a campaign was launch ed to raise $20,000."
"by august of 1941, $4,600."
"in cash and 50,000 feet of lumber had been donated."
the plan was to have a wooden building with a slate roof.
"when $10,000 was on hand the building would be started."
"before the end of the year, vvorldwar ii disrupted all the plans."
"a few donations continued to come in, and the local organizations and school classes continued to make annual contributions."
all organized campaigns were suspended for the next five years.
"a monson academy alumni association was organ ized in june of 1947. the first meeting for organization was held at the masonic hall june 13, 1947 with esther pennington acting as chairman of organization for the alumni association."
at that meeting the following were chosen as officers: pres.
- stanwood pullen; v.--pres.
harland johnson; sec.
- eloise stevens and oswald poole as treasurer.
prior to this meeting the by-laws for the association were written by millard emanuelson as early as 1937. this group decided to back the gym project.
"there was $16,000."
"in the treasury, and the alumni association history of monson, maine 23 hoped to double the amount."
the project was known as the monson gym fund from that time on.
the steady rise in cost of materials and labor made the original type of building beyond reach.
it was de cided to have a pre-fabricated type of aluminum building.
"the sum of $22,437.50 was needed to have an outlined building with foundation, walls and insulation."
the structure was started and once more an appeal was made for subscriptions.
"the response was generous, but there was only enough funds to carry on work for a few months."
"at the town meeting on march 11, 1950, the town voted to borrow the sum of ten thousand dollars for the completion of the monson gym and the same to be paid back by the alumni association in ten notes, with each one being for a thousand dollars plus interest."
the same year monthly committees were appointed to raise at least $100.00 a month.

this section was rebuilt as follows from knight's store to the canal - grover's now the laundramat owned by laurice goodwin - orrin rice - now donald keene block - e. mclver --last known as arvid anderson's store which was demolished in 1966 - j. davison - now edward adams and used for storage.
"the first fire apparatus is now in a museum in meredith, new hampshire."
"the monson fire department was organized in 1937, with dennis weeks as chief, and sixteen members who were arthur day, merton grover, clair sargent, stanley stevens, cliff simpson, henry knight, erick erickson, arthur haggstrom, fred berry, anselm swanson, paul jackson, guy hammond, thomas mountain, elwin french, robert benton and eugene bickford."
"56 history of monson, maine the first fire house was in the old gar hall known as the old town hall on main street and remained there until 1968 when the new municipal building was built."
"in 1937, the first motor driven fire engine was pur chased which is still being used today."
"the department presently has two fire engines, two tank trucks and an army surplus truck."
an alarm system was installed on the top of the old town hall building.
prior to this the church bells were used as a means of an alarm.
"on may 3, 1946, arthur haggstrom became fire chief, a post he>> held until march 28, 1961, when john ruksznis became chief and who holds this office at the present time."
the fire department now consists of 20 men who attend regular meetings and training sessions.
monson has been the victim of many fires over the years.
"in may, 1824, a fire which started on what is now the common, where the forest was being cleared away, threatened to destroy what buildings there were in the vicinity."
"all the help that could be found worked hard for a day and night to save the mills, two houses and one or two outbuildings then standing where the village; is now."
then another fire struck the town in the autumn of 1825. this fire swept across a large portion of this state destroying great tracts of timber land.
"many of the build ings were in danger, but through strenuous efforts, none were destroyed."
"again in the spring of 1831, the village was threat ened once more."
the great fire (taken from the 1914 pharetra) it is quite a look backward over the nearly fifty-four years since the great fire in monson.
"within this period monson has been visited by a number of serious confla grations but none of them has destroyed so large a history of monson, maine 57 proportion of the buildings as that on may 27, 1860, which swept away most of the village."
"few who were then of adult age are now living, and those who were: then chidren are well along in years."
"prior to 1860, monson enjoyed a remarkable ex emption from serious fires."
"the town in common with others suffered from the great forest fires of 1825, but from 1818 to 1860, according to reverend charles davi son's semi--centennialaddress, only four dwelling houses had been destroyed by fire; namely, that of samuel rowe in the winter of 1818-19, that of calvin colton in the spring of 1823, that of george doughty in 1836 and that of alexander greenwood houston in november, 1852. for seven years after this last fire the sound of the fire bell had not been heard."
"its silence was first broken march 31, 1860, when the academy burned, to be fol lowed by a greater conflagration not quite two months later."
"in may, 1860, the weather had been for several weeks warm and dry."
there were no slated roofs in monson then and the shingles on the roofs were dry as tinder.
"sunday, may 27, was a calm and pleasant day with a light south wind."
"shortly after the close of the morning services the sabbath stillness was broken by the wild cry of ""fire"" and the ringing of the bell in the congregational church."
"looking across the little pond from the window of my father's house, then standing on the site now occupied by i. p. wing's residence (now the home of edwin holm bom's), i saw the flames pouring from the roof of the>> stable connected with nelson savage's hotel called the ""mansion house"", the hotel being on the site now occu pied by peleg w. knight's store, and the stable a little south and in the rear."
"in the few minutes required to reach the spot, the flames had spread to the hotel and the inmates were throwing, out of doors and windows, 58 history of monson, maine beds, bedding and furniture in frantic effort to save something from the wreck."
the heat generated an active air current and the flames with a wild roar devoured everything they touched in an incredibly short time.
"the burnin.g shingles were swept high in the air and were carried by the now accelerated south wind northward, immediately setting fire to any roof on which they dropped."
the flames mocked the puny efforts to stay their onward rush with water pails and buckets - the only fire-fighting apparatus in the village.
it was a spectacle at once grand and awful to see almost the entire village in flames at once.
the fire began about one p. m. or a little earlier and by three p. m. the work of destruction was substantially complete.
"when the sun set on that eventful day, little was left in the central part of the village but a mass of smoking ruins."
"except a small shop next north of the canal, every building on the west side of main street from the man sion hotel north was destroyed."
this included tarr's and knight's blacksmith shops.
"tenney's wheelwright shop, j. h. pullen's store and home of deacon ""ward on the lot afterwards of a. s. garland (now gordon hal1's home)."
"the fire also destroyed a cabinet shop of elias t. andrews and dwelling of albion jackson, both on pleasant street the latter on the site of mrs."
hattie crafts' residence (now known as esther pennington's home).
only a change of wind prevented the flames.
from sweeping up church street.
"on the east side of main street every building north of the canal to and including the congregational church was burned, in cluding aretas chapin's extensive farm."
"buildings, oliver eveleth's store (now erma smal1's home) and dwelling occupied by a. g. houston (former d. a. r. chapter house) and the hotel called the ""monson house"" (located in the general area of berwin storer's home) then kept by solomon j. chandler."
"(note: aretas history of monson, maine 59 chapin's farm was about where louise grover's home now stands.)"
"in the midst of the excitement a dwelling house on central street formerly occupied by honorable j. h. rice on the lot afterwards of a. f. jackson (now the home of edward laverty which was formerly owned by ansel lapointe), caught fire from the flying embers and was speedily burned to the ground."
"in the space of two hours, about forty buildings were totally destroyed with a large portion of their contents."
so rapidly did the>> flames spread that there was little opportunity to save.
anything.
"the buildings destroyed included one church, two hotels, three of the four stores, six dwellings be sides shops, one law office, barns and outbuildings."
the business part of the village was practically wiped out.
some of the sufferers were stripped of substantially all their earthly possessions.
some had no insurance and others while less unfortunate never recovered from their losses.
"to crown all, certain disreputable characters from outside added plunder to the troubles of the suf ferers."
"the total losses were estimated at $22,750 and in surance only $9,600."
at the scale of prices prevailing this meant much more than the same figures would represent today and gives a very imperfect idea of the magnitude of the misfortune which for the moment over whelmed the little village.
"the heaviest losers were nelson savage, $1,300; j. h. pullen, $2,800; congrega tional society, $1,200; with no insurance; solomon j. chandler, $3,000; oliver eveleth, $2,200; and aretas chapin, $8,000."
"the figures are those given in the ob server at the time, and those losses except in the case of the church were partially covered by insurance."
the business men sought such accomodations as they could find.
"the post office was for some time kept in the rear wing of horace flanders' house (now tolford 60 history of monson, maine durham's)."
some who had been in business at monson sought other fields of activity.
it was many years before the village regained its former prosperity.
the cause of the fire was never certainly known.
one rumor attributed it to certain half intoxicated per sons smoking in the hay loft of nelson savage's stable.
others believed that the fire was deliberately set by an offender who had been arrested in monson shortly before and who threatened vengeance upon the town.
"no attempt was made however (perhaps from lack of evidence) to bring the culprit, if such he was, to justice."
incidentally the fire resulted in one important bene fit in ridding monson (let us hope forever) from hotels in which intoxicating liquor was kept for sale.
"shortly after the fire aretas chapin opened a hotel (built on the site of the now bartlett's gulf station), which until it burned on march 25, 1882, maintained a consistent and honorable record as a temperance hotel, and this excel lent record has, i believe been maintained by hotels since opened in monson."
dudley p. bailey the alarm of fire rang at 4 a. in.
"on friday the 28th of december of 1888. the engine house with the g.a.r hall above, the building owned by hilman bros."
"and used as a furniture and tailor's shop, and mr."
"boynton's fine new buildings, store and dwelling with barn adjoining and a dry house filled with lumber belonging to the mon son refrigerator co."
were swept away in an hour's time.
it was the most disasterous fire since 1860. the town lost the road machine for which it paid $225.00 just two years before.
the buildings burnt nearly together and almost everything in them was destroyed.
the hearse was saved.

"this done, main street looked spic and span."
"the residence of w. harry hughes being directly across the street and opposite the honor roll, made a fine place to carry out the prepared program."
"the veran da at the hughes residence was prettily decorated with 66 history of monson, maine baskets of flowers and served as a platform for those taking part in the ceremonies."
a loudspeaker system was installed so all could hear throughout the business section.
"long before the hour set for the dedication exer cises, two oclock, p. m., people began to gather and autos took available parking space."
arthur l. bray very efficiently presided.
monson band was assembled on the spacious lawn in front of the hughes home.
"very soon after 2 o'clock, mr."
"bray announced the opening of the program, a selection by the band."
prayer was offered by rev.
"joseph griffiths, pastor of the methodist church in guilford."

mr.

this was followed by the playing of the star spangled banner by the band.
mr.

captain pernet expressed his great pleasure at being prsent at this occasion and comp limented the people of monson for their deep interest in erecting such a beautiful honor roll.

"evening, august 14th, as they have been for the past 4 or 5 years, for the welcome news all have been longing to hear - the end of the war."
early evening broadcasts announced that at 7 o'clock important news would be given out and it is safe to say that every radio was tuned in to get that announcement.
"68 history of monson, maine it came as scheduled and the townspeople let loose the joy in their hearts in their own individual ways."
"the fire siren blew for a full 15 minutes, it sounded sweet to the ear, much sweeter than in the dead hours of night for a fire."
automobile horns took up the refrain throughout the town and in the distance the powerful portland-monson slate co.
whistle echoed back.
the peal of the church bells added to the noise.
monson band quickly assembled in front of the town hall and dispensed stirring music until darkness covered their music.
"an impromptu parade of happy mothers, wives, sisters and sweethearts, as well as many children, grabbing anything they could make a. noise upon, pa raded back and forth on main street and the band played on."
"at times the whistles, horns and noise of the paraders nearly drowned out the band."
later during the evening several cannon shots reminded the inhabitants that the war was ended.
"the american legion opened their hall and free dancing was enjoyed for several hours, music furnished by frank hughes, alvin cowan, orman kron holm and archie johnson."

"knut felix ohman, who was finnish, and a baratone player equal to any in new england."
