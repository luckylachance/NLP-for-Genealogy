    "##### NLTK Corpus Explained,\n",
    "\n",
    "In linguistics, a corpus (plural corpora) or text corpus is a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). In NLTK a corpus package defines a collection english (or other language) classes, which can be used to access the contents of a diverse set of corpora. The list of available corpora is given at: http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/ Each corpus reader class is specialized to handle a specific corpus format. In addition, the nltk corpus reader functions can be given lists of item names; they return a concatenation of:\n",
    "    - words(): list of str\n",
    "    - sents(): list of (list of str)\n",
    "    - paras(): list of (list of (list of str))\n",
    "    - tagged_words(): list of (str,str) tuple\n",
    "    - tagged_sents(): list of (list of (str,str))\n",
    "    - tagged_paras(): list of (list of (list of (str,str)))\n",
    "    - chunked_sents(): list of (Tree w/ (str,str) leaves)\n",
    "    - parsed_sents(): list of (Tree with str leaves)\n",
    "    - parsed_paras(): list of (list of (Tree with str leaves))\n",
    "    - xml(): A single xml ElementTree\n",

    "2.  <u>Verify my set of stopwords </u> from english corpus, Stopwords are the English words which do not add clarity or value to a sentence. They can safely be ignored without sacrificing the meaning of the sentence -- most of the time.  Be cautious though because the use of \"married\" versus \"<b>not</b> married\" to a person may return a different outcome. Examples of linguistic noise might include words like \"the\", \"he\", \"have\" etc. Such words are already captured the NLTK corpus named <b>corpus</b>. "

    "    <b>Lemmatization</b> in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form.  For example  -> rocks : rock-> corpora : corpus -> better : good .  Lemmatization converts words (in a sentence) to their stem while respecting their context. For example, the sentence “You are not better than me” would become “You be not good than me”. This is useful when dealing with NLP preprocessing, for example to train doc2vec models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <b>WordNet</b> is a part of Python's Natural Language Toolkit. It is a large word database that can be employed to tag  Parts of speech like English Nouns, Adjectives, Adverbs and Verbs. These are grouped into some set of cognitive synonyms, which are called synsets. In the wordnet, there are some groups of words, whose meaning are same.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By default, the lemmatizer takes in an input string and tries to lemmatize it, so if you pass in a word, it would lemmatize it treating it as a noun, it does take the POS tag into account, but it doesn’t magically determine it.\n",
    "        * nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize('loving') returns 'loving'\n",

    "    \n",
    "    To make the lemmatization better and context dependent, we would need to find out the POS tag and pass it on to the lemmatizer. We would first find out the POS tag for each token using NLTK, use that to find the corresponding tag in WordNet and then use the lemmatizer to lemmatize the token based on the tag.. Here is what it would look like:\n"

    "#### Extracting Features (VECTORIZING)\n",
    "\n",
    "in NLTK Features are a sequence of words or sentences in a <b> numeric vector </b> The vector for each word is a semantic description of how that word is used in context, so two words that are used similarly in text will get similar vector represenations. Once you map words into vector space, you can then use vector math to find words that have similar semantics (proximity). In this notebook <b>TF-IDF</b>, <b>Word2Vec</b> and <b>Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF)</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u><b> TF-IDF </b></u> converts a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features.  Using TF-IDF embeddings, words will be represented as a single scaler number based on TF-IDF scores. TF-IDF is the combination of TF (Term Frequency) and IDF (Inverse Document Frequency). TF gives the count of word t in document.  Mathematically we can write tf(t,d). IDF gives information about how the word is common or rare across all document. It is the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain the word.\n",

    "    Mathematically,\n",
    "    idf(t,D) = log (N/dfi) , where N or |D| = Total Number of Document, and dfi = Number of document where the term t appears.\n",
    "    TF-IDF(t, d, D) = tf(t,d) . idf(t,D)\n",

    "    Smooth inverse frequency embeddings were originally conceived by [1] and the corresponding paper has been presented at the 2017 ICLR. The code for the original paper is available at Github. The authors present a nice probabilistic motivation for the inverse frequency weighted continuous bag-of-words model. We are not going into the technical details of the math, but rather into the optimization of the algorithm for computing the SIF embeddings. If you have to compute the SIF embeddings for millions of sentences, you need a routine to accomplish the task in a lifetime. "
